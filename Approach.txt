1. Changed position to absolute from fixed for the dropdown container (bug1) 
2. Checkbox, input css fixed (bug 2); 
3. Changed the onChange handler on inputselect for employees, added condition if id="", return all data.(bug3) 
4. UsePaginatedTransactions returned just new data, fixed by appending the new data to previous one.
5. set loading to false after we get all employees and before paginatedTxns(bug5: p1,p2)
6. View More button condition added, keep disabled if nextpage is null or transaction of employee is empty. (bug6: p1,p2)
7. Using the cached data, the property checked is updated in the backend but when we do loadAllTransactions() the cached data is load that doesn't have the updated property. Here we need to make a new call to get all data so that we get fresh data.
